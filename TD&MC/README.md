This notebook applies value-based reinforcement learning to the **CliffWalking-v0** environment from Gymnasium, implementing Monte Carlo and temporal-difference control algorithms. It covers trajectory generation, first-visit MC online updates, training loops, and performance evaluation with visualizations of the learned behavior.
